# Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments

## Project Overview

This project focuses on discovering internal structures, patterns, and knowledge from a dataset containing various customers' annual spending amounts across diverse product categories. The primary objective is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their spending behavior using unsupervised learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises customer spending data across multiple product categories. Each entry represents the annual spending (in monetary units) for a particular customer on different products.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough exploration and preprocessing to clean and normalize the data, ensuring it's suitable for clustering algorithms.
  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving significant variance, facilitating better visualization and interpretation of customer segments.
  
- **Clustering:** Implemented K-Means clustering to group customers based on their spending patterns, identifying distinct customer segments.

- **Visualization and Insights:** Visualized the clustered data to gain insights into the different customer segments, providing actionable information for targeted marketing strategies.

## Results

- Successfully segmented customers into distinct groups with similar spending patterns.
- Provided a comprehensive analysis of each segment, highlighting key characteristics and potential marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering, in uncovering hidden patterns within customer data. The insights gained can be leveraged for personalized marketing, improving customer satisfaction, and increasing business profitability.
